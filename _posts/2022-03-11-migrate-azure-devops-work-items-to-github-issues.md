## Overview

Quick post since most of this is in the [README in the repo](https://github.com/joshjohanning/ado_workitems_to_github_issues), but I created a Powershell script to migrate Azure DevOps work items to GitHub Issues. It's certainly not perfect, but there wasn't anything else out there I could find. If you do find something better, please do let me know!
