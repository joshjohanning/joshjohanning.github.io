## Overview

I realized that there wasn't any content of me speaking on the internet, just blogging, so I thought I would at least create one! This is a video I created to explain the features of GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS), features, and some tips and tricks for configuring and interpreting the results along the way. 

I admittedly didn't put a ton of polish around the video, but I hope it's useful as a primer if you are new to GitHub Advanced Security, or even if you're not new, perhaps you'll learn a few new things along the way.

Enjoy!
