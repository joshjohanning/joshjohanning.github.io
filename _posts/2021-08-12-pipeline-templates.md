## Overview

Although linked in various posts in this blog, I never fully advertise my `pipeline-templates` GitHub repository. I refer back to this every so often to see how I accomplished something in the past with various pipeline YAML concepts and will often share to others when they are in need of an example to follow.

In each folder, you will typically see the build as well as the deployment yaml template. I also started including the `azure-pipelines-*.yml`{: .filepath} file to show an example of how to consume/reference the pipeline templates.

Let me know if there are any questions or areas for improvement!
